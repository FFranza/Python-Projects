# Python Workshop Week 3
***Workshop estimated time: 25 Minutes~***
### Objectives Today:
* Reviewing over last week's outline, and reviewing over it
    * Using functions to change type of value
    * Input, append, and pop
    * Comments
* For loops and While loops
    * What's the difference?
* Touch over Classes
    * Initialize function
    * Self usage and why?
### Prompts today:
#### Checking over stocks
I am starting to a create a list of stock items in a grocery store. I am not so sure how to start but I need some way to always loop through the items to make sure I have them in stock. Can you make a an iteration of items to make sure I have in stock?
* Create two `lists` that will iterate through fruits and vegetables
    * Fruits inside the first `list`: Apple, Pear, Orange, Strawberry, and Mango
    * Vegetables inside the second `list`: Bok Choy, Lettuce, Tomato, Ginger, Garlic
* Use a `for` loop then `print` the list out and show the iteration works

**COMMENT OVER ON WHY ON HOW IT WORKS**
#### Creating a loading bar
YOU! YES YOU INTERN. I NOW YOU'RE NEW HERE BUT I NEED YOU WORKING. I know we don't have the budget to develop with famed developers so I need you to create a simple loading screen `conditional sequence` that starts from 0 then adds up to 100. BUT, IT WILL ONLY GO THROUGH IF the player `inputs` that they want to play the game! THIS IS DUE IN TONIGHT, WORK WORK WORK
* Use the `input` function to take in a answer of `Play` before the loading screen can start counting
* The `while` loop should go from 0 to 100
    * Once the while loop finishes the program should `print` "The game has finished loading!"
