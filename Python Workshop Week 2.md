### Prompts today:
#### My Grades?!
* Foo is worried about his final grade, he needs to figure out if he got an A or not. So far he has a grade of: *73, 92, 89, 90*. He needs to add a grade of 93 after the last final exam he had to take. Create a small script that allows Foo to add into his current grades, average the value, then print it out to tell him what he got.
    * Create a list known as `current_grades`
    * Use the `input` function and convert that input into a intenger
    * Create a function named `calculate` with no parameters
    * Use the `sum` function to add the contents inside the `current_grade` list and divide it by 5
    * Store the function inside the variable the print the output
#### Reading, Comment, and Debug!
* Frederick is trying to make a workshop based on introducing people to Python. He created a simple script to teach people how to write in Python but didn't figure why he was getting a traceback error. He also forgot to add comments for attendees to inform what the script is about. Fix the script and allow it to run before his workshop starts.
